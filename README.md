# Revolutionizing Diagnosis: Deep Learning-Based COVID-19 Detection System
This repository contains the code files and image samples for a deep learning-based COVID-19 detection system using image processing techniques.

## Code Files
The code directory contains the following files:

preprocessing.py: This script preprocesses the input images by applying necessary transformations such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

model.py: This script defines the architecture of the deep learning model used for COVID-19 detection.

train.py: This script trains the model on the preprocessed dataset and saves the trained model weights.

test.py: This script loads the trained model and performs inference on test images to predict COVID-19 cases.

## Image Samples
The image_samples directory contains a set of sample images used for testing the COVID-19 detection system. These images include chest X-rays or CT scans of both COVID-19 positive and negative cases.

## Getting Started
To run the code and test the COVID-19 detection system, follow these steps:

Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Preprocess the dataset by running python preprocessing.py.

Train the model using the preprocessed dataset by running python train.py.

Evaluate the model's performance on test images by running python test.py.

Please note that you may need to modify the code files according to your specific dataset and requirements.
